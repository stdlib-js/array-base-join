    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
import join from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-base-join@deno/mod.js';
```
The previous example will load the latest bundled code from the deno branch. Alternatively, you may load a specific version by loading the file from one of the [tagged bundles](https://github.com/stdlib-js/array-base-join/tags). For example,

```javascript
import join from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-base-join@v0.1.2-deno/mod.js';
```

#### join( x, separator )

Returns a string created by joining array elements using a specified separator.

```javascript
var x = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ];

var out = join( x, ',' );
// returns '1,2,3,4,5,6'
```

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   If provided an array-like object having a `join` method, the function defers execution to that method and assumes that the method API has the following signature:

    ```text
    x.join( separator )
    ```

-   If provided an array-like object without a `join` method, the function manually constructs the output string.

-   If an array element is either `null` or `undefined`, the function will serialize the element as an empty string.

import join from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-base-join@deno/mod.js';

var x = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];
var s = join( x, ',' );
// returns '0,1,2,3,4,5'

x = new Float64Array( [ 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 ] );

// returns '0,1,2,3,4,5'

s = join( x, '-' );
// returns '0-1-2-3-4-5'

x = new AccessorArray( [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ] );
s = join( x, ',' );
// returns '1,2,3,4'

x = new Complex128Array( [ 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 ] );
s = join( x, ',' );
// returns '1 + 2i,3 + 4i,5 + 6i'

x = new Complex64Array( [ 1.0, -1.0, 2.0, -2.0 ] );
s = join( x, ',' );
// returns '1 - 1i,2 - 2i'
